# Release notes

## Keeping standart symbols

First, before anything else, I would like to say that layouts serve to facilitate access to symbols that are not normally assigned, making it unnecessary to memorize codes or access a file or auxiliary program containing a table for quick use.

For this reason I decided to leave frequently used symbols in the same positions (or analogous positions) to make them easier to use.

Code| Symbol | Description
----|:------:|------------
001 |   `©`  | **Copyright** - Maintained because it is widely used, regardless of the layout used (esoteric, astronomical, alchemical and/or Juvelic).
001 |   `®`  | **Registered** - Maintained because it is widely used, regardless of the layout used (esoteric, astronomical, alchemical and/or Juvelic).
001 |   `π`  | **Greek Pi** - Maintained because it is widely used, regardless of the layout used (esoteric, astronomical, alchemical and/or Juvelic).
001 | `ª` `º`  | **Ord Feminine** and **Masculine**.
